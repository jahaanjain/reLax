              <p>Did you know there are many benefits to listening to music? Crank up the tunes and blast those beats, because the results are in — music is good for you.</p>
              <p>We know the healing power of music. Bad breakup? Cue “We Are Never Getting Back Together” by Taylor Swift. Powering through a long run? Jam out to Eminem’s “Lose Yourself”.</p>
              <p>Music can soothe the brokenhearted, motivate runners and kickoff the most epic dance parties, but it also has some serious scientific benefits for our health and overall wellbeing.</p>
              <p>Listening to music has been shown to improve memory functioning, increase rate of healing, improve your workouts and more.</p>
              <p>And&nbsp;now… a crazy science fact:</p>
              <div class="youtubeContainer"><iframe class="youtubeIframe" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/z-4pS2mSpmY" type="text/html" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>
              <h2>Music Improves&nbsp;Memory</h2>
              <p>
                Patients with memory loss can often remember songs and specific song lyrics. Doctors will often use&nbsp;music and lyric recall to help individuals retrieve lost memories. Certain music can trigger particularly unique memories- music from a specific time period will trigger memories from that time
                period. Want to remember something from the past? Listen to songs you listened to during that time!
              </p>
              <p>
                Music and its effect on memory has been a heated debate in the scientific world, but researchers &nbsp;now have evidence that the processing of music and language, specifically memorizing information, rely on some of the same brain systems. Researchers have also uncovered evidence that suggests the
                music we heard as teenagers has a greater emotional bind to our brain than anything we’ll listen to as adults. This idea&nbsp;of musical nostalgia is a fun exercise for anyone, but is most impactful for people suffering from memory loss, including those with dementia or Alzheimer’s.
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">Here’s a <a href="http://www.alzheimersreadingroom.com/2011/05/power-of-music-in-alzheimers-disease.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" dir="ltr">story</a>&nbsp;about the transformative power of music from one man whose father has Alzheimer’s:</p>
              <blockquote><p>“As a family, we didn’t know what to do when our father was diagnosed with this Alzheimer’s disease. We have been through so many stages and now he seems to just be deteriorating to nothing. However, the music seems to have brought back some of his brain to him!”</p></blockquote>
              <p>Music and musical training have also been shown to protect the aging brain and keep it healthy.</p>
              <p>University of Kansas Medical Center researchers conducted an experiment where they&nbsp;divided 70 healthy adults, ages 60 to 83, into three groups based on their amount of musical experience: no musical training, one to nine years of music lessons and at least 10 years of musical study.</p>
              <p>The participants, who had similar fitness and education levels and were free of Alzheimer’s disease, were given several cognitive tests:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Those with the greatest amount of musical experience did best on these tests of mental acuity, followed by those with less musical study followed by&nbsp;those who never took music lessons.</li>
                <li>&nbsp;Compared to non-musicians, the individuals&nbsp;with a high degree of musical experience had much higher scores on the cognitive tests, including those related to visual and spacial&nbsp;memory, naming objects and the brain’s ability to adapt to new information</li>
              </ul>
              <p dir="ltr">The really cool part? The benefits of musical study and training were still apparent <strong dir="ltr">even in participants who no longer played an instrument</strong>.</p>
              <p dir="ltr"><strong dir="ltr">Bottom Line</strong>: You can now tell your mom that those hours of trombone practice for high school band were totally worth it.</p>
              <h2>Music Improves Workouts</h2>
              <p>StairMaster got you down? Feeling sluggish on the treadmill?</p>
              <p>Grab your earbuds and get jammin’!</p>
              <p>Not only can music distract you from “bodily awareness” aka the aches and pains of working out, it has a health effect too.</p>
              <p dir="ltr">
                Listening to music releases <a href="https://www.scienceofpeople.com/2015/08/how-to-snap-out-of-a-funk/" rel="noopener noreferrer" dir="ltr">endorphins</a> in the brain. Endorphins give us a heightened feeling of excitement. In addition to feeling euphoric, endorphins quell anxiety, ease pain and
                stabilize the&nbsp;immune system. With high endorphin levels, we have fewer negative effects of stress.
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
                Turning up your tunes can also up the effort you exert during&nbsp;exercise. In one <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19793214" rel="noopener noreferrer" dir="ltr">study</a>, researchers found that cyclists worked harder and biked a further distance when listening to faster music as compared
                to music with a slower tempo.&nbsp;When the tempo slowed, so did their pedaling and their entire effect. Their heart rates fell and their mileage dropped. They
                <a href="https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/25/phys-ed-does-music-make-you-exercise-harder/?_r=0" rel="noopener noreferrer" dir="ltr">reported</a> that they didn’t like the music much. On the other hand, when the tempo of the songs was upped 10 percent, the men covered more miles in the same period
                of time, produced more power with each pedal stroke and increased their pedal cadences.
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
                For pace-based exercises like running or weight-lifting, music <a href="http://bura.brunel.ac.uk/handle/2438/6312" rel="noopener noreferrer" dir="ltr">can help regulate</a> rhythm and signal&nbsp;to the&nbsp;the&nbsp;brain when the body should move. This signal helps us to use our energy more
                efficiently, so we’re not exhausting ourselves too soon.
              </p>

                Got the groove? In <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23660433" rel="noopener noreferrer" dir="ltr">scientific terms</a>, groove is often described as a musical quality that can induce movement in a listener. Basically, you can’t stop yourself from moving! The next time you hit the gym,
                channel your inner diva and get groovin’!
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
                <strong dir="ltr">Bottom Line</strong>: Make a playlist just for the gym or for working out. Need some ideas? Check out this list of the <a href="http://www.fitnessmagazine.com/workout/music/popular-playlists/100-best-workout-songs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" dir="ltr">100 best workout songs</a> from

              <h2>Music Helps You Heal</h2>
              <p dir="ltr">
                A <a href="http://thenaturalbackpaincure.com/tag/austrias-general-hospital-of-salzburg/" rel="noopener noreferrer" dir="ltr">study</a> from Austria’s General Hospital of Salzburg found that patients recovering from back surgery had increased rates of healing and reported less pain when music was
                incorporated into the standard rehabilitation process.
              </p>
              <blockquote><p>“Music is an important part of our physical and emotional well-being, ever since we were babies in our mother’s womb listening to her heartbeat and breathing rhythms.” – Lead clinical psychologist of Austria General, Franz Wendtner.</p></blockquote>
              <p>Music connects with the automatic nervous system (brain function, blood pressure and heartbeat) and the limbic system (feelings and emotions).</p>
              <p>
                When slow music is played, the bodily reaction follows suit– the heart blow slows down and blood pressure drops. This causes the breath to slow, which helps release tension in the neck, shoulders, stomach and back.&nbsp;Listening to slow or calming music on a regular basis can help our bodies relax,
                which over time, means less pain and faster recovery time.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finnish researchers conducted a similar study, but with stroke patients. They found that&nbsp;if stroke patients listened to music for a couple of hours a day, their verbal memory and focused attention recovered better and they had a more positive mood than patients who did not listen to anything or who
                listened to audio books.
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
                These findings have led to a clinical recommendation for stroke patients: <strong dir="ltr">everyday music listening during early stroke recovery offers a valuable addition to the patients’ care</strong>&nbsp;by providing an “individually targeted, easy-to-conduct and inexpensive means to facilitate
                cognitive and emotional recovery,” says Teppo Särkämö, author of the <a href="http://www.news-medical.net/news/2008/02/20/35390.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" dir="ltr">study</a>.
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
                With brain-imaging techniques, such as functional MRIs, music is increasingly being used in therapy for brain-related injuries and diseases. Brain scans have proven that music and motor control share circuits, so music can improve movement for those with Parkinson’s disease and for individuals
                recovering from a stroke. Neurologic music therapy should become part of rehabilitative care, according to <a href="http://www.brainline.org/content/2011/03/how-music-helps-to-heal-the-injured-brain.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" dir="ltr">this group of doctors</a>. They believe that future findings
                may well indicate that music should be included on the list of therapies and rehabilitation for many disorders.
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr"><strong dir="ltr">Bottom Line</strong>: Adding music to a standard rehabilitative process helps patients heal.</p>
              <h2>Music Reduces Stress and Eases Anxiety</h2>
              <p dir="ltr">Music has a unique link to our emotions, and <a href="https://psychcentral.com/lib/the-power-of-music-to-reduce-stress/" rel="noopener noreferrer" dir="ltr">research</a> has found that it can be used as an extremely effective stress management tool.</p>
              <p dir="ltr">
                Just like listening to slow music to calm the body, music can also have a relaxing effect on the mind. <a href="http://www.unr.edu/counseling/virtual-relaxation-room/releasing-stress-through-the-power-of-music" rel="noopener noreferrer" dir="ltr">Researchers</a> at Stanford University found that
                listening to music seems to be able to change brain functioning to the same extent as medication. Since music is so widely available and inexpensive, it’s an easy stress reduction option.
              </p>
              <p>So, what type of music reduces stress best? Here’s what we found:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Native American, Celtic, Indian stringed-instruments, drums and flutes</li>
                <li>sounds of rain, thunder and nature sounds</li>
                <li>light jazz, classical and easy listening music</li>
              </ul>
              <p>You must be the ultimate judge, however, of “relaxing music.” If Mozart isn’t quite doing it for you,&nbsp;explore other options that help you naturally relax.</p>
              <p dir="ltr">
                HelpGuide.org, a nonprofit mental health and well-being organization encourages individuals to practice a healthy <em dir="ltr">sonic</em> diet. They suggest that “when&nbsp;choosing locations to eat, hold business meetings, or visit with friends, be conscious of the sound environment, including the
                noise level and type of music that is played. Loud noisy environments, as much as we try to ignore them, can contribute to unconscious stress and tension build-up without us even knowing it.”
              </p>
              <p>Just like junk food increases stress in our system, a poor sonic or listening diet can do the same. Choose quieter environments and settings to prime your body to relax and recharge.</p>
              <p dir="ltr">
                Making music can also <a href="http://www.webmd.com/balance/stress-management/features/how-making-music-reduces-stress" rel="noopener noreferrer" dir="ltr">release tension</a> and relieve stress. Dana Marlowe, a technology accessibility consultant, gets relief from her daily work&nbsp;challenges in her
                toddler’s playroom:
              </p>
              <blockquote><p>I just jam out with his toys — the xylophone, the baby piano. I almost have ‘Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star’ down.</p></blockquote>
              <p dir="ltr">
                Research has shown that casual music-making can short-circuit the stress response system and keep it from recurring or becoming chronic. WebMD tells us that “stress starts in the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.webmd.com/brain/picture-of-the-brain" dir="ltr">brain</a>&nbsp;and then kicks off a chain reaction
                that switches on the stress response in every cell of our bodies. Over time, these cellular switches can get stuck in the ‘on’ position, leading to feelings of burnout, anger, or&nbsp;<a href="http://www.webmd.com/depression/default.htm" dir="ltr">depression</a>&nbsp;as well as a host of physical
                ailments.”
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr"><strong dir="ltr">Bottom line</strong>: Both listening to and making music can alleviate mild and chronic stress.</p>
              <h2>Music Improves Sleep Quality</h2>
              <p>Insomnia and other sleep deprivation issues can wreck havoc on our lives. What if music could help?</p>
              <p dir="ltr">
                According to one <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18426457" rel="noopener noreferrer" dir="ltr">study</a> conducted by&nbsp;Harmat,&nbsp;Takács and&nbsp;Bódizs, 94 students (ages 19 to 28) with sleep complaints were brought into the lab. Participants were split into 3 groups. The first group
                listened to classical music at bedtime for 45 minutes for 3 weeks. The second group listened to an audiobook at bedtime for 45 minutes for 3 weeks. The control group&nbsp;received no intervention.
              </p>
              <p>Sleep quality and depressive symptoms were measured using the&nbsp;Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index and the&nbsp;Beck Depression Inventory respectively. The results?</p>
              <p>The participants who listened to music showed statistically significant improvements in sleep quality and a decrease in depressive symptoms. There were no statistically significant results found for the audiobook or control group.</p>
              <p dir="ltr">
                The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Strokes <a href="http://wellness.pittsburghsymphony.org/can-music-help-you-get-a-good-nights-sleep/" rel="noopener noreferrer" dir="ltr">claim</a> that “an estimated 40 million Americans annually live with chronic sleep disorders, while 20 million
                more have trouble sleeping from time to time.”
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
                In one <a href="http://www.journalofnursingstudies.com/article/S0020-7489(13)00096-5/fulltext" rel="noopener noreferrer" dir="ltr">meta-analysis</a> of 10 randomized studies, researchers tracked 557 participants with chronic sleep disorders. They found that sleep quality was improved significantly with
                music and concluded that “music can assist in improving sleep quality of patients with acute and chronic sleep disorders.”

              <p dir="ltr"><strong dir="ltr">Bottom Line:</strong> Sleep better, longer and with fewer disturbances by listening to music at bedtime.</p>
              <p>The next time you crank up the music in an&nbsp;impromptu&nbsp;dance party, remember all of the health benefits too. Music has been proven to help our bodies heal, improve memory, alleviate stress and more. And that is most certainly, music to my ears.</p>
